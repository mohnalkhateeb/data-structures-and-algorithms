## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I use for loop to put array[i] in index [arrayLength-i+1] of other array have the reverse resulte and I used other loop to print the reverse array I think this take the O(n) time and O(1) space
